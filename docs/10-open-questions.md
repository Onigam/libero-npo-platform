## Strategic / Product Vision

### 8. Libero as an organizational platform — not just a CRM

**Question raised**: Should Libero go beyond CRM and become the central organizational hub of an NPO — integrating communication, collaboration, and AI participation?

**Context**: NPO staff spend time split between their CRM (data) and communication tools (Slack, WhatsApp, email). This fragmentation creates friction and breaks context. A platform that unifies data + communication could be a significant differentiator and "future-proof" the product.

**Options analyzed**:

| Approach | Effort | Differentiating? | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Build full Slack/Discord replacement | Very high — competes with Slack | Not really, and we'd lose | ❌ Reject |
| Threaded activity feed on every record | Medium — build once, high value | Yes — contextual collaboration | ✅ v1.1 target |
| @mention and notifications within platform | Low-medium | Yes — connects staff to records | ✅ v1 consideration |
| AI as a mentionable team participant | Medium — AI infra already exists | **Highly differentiating** | ✅ v2 target |
| Video call button (Whereby/Jitsi embed) | Low — integration only | Nice to have | ✅ Simple integration |
| Organization activity feed (news feed) | Medium | Differentiating | ✅ v1.1 target |

**Recommended direction**:

#### v1: Foundation
- **Record-level activity feed**: every mutation on a constituent, grant, or case creates a feed entry visible to the team
- **Threaded comments on records**: staff can comment inline on any record, with @mention support
- **In-app notifications**: consolidate all notifications (AI suggestions, deadlines, @mentions) in one inbox

#### v1.1: Collaboration layer
- **Organization activity feed** (homepage): real-time feed of what's happening across the org — donations received, cases updated, grants awarded, volunteers confirmed
- **Video meeting button**: embed Whereby/Jitsi on any record for ad-hoc calls with a funder, a beneficiary, a volunteer
- **Shared workspaces per grant/program**: a focused view combining data + discussion + documents for a specific project

#### v2: AI as a team member
- **@Libero in any thread**: tag the AI in any conversation to ask questions, get context, trigger actions
  - Example: "@Libero quelle est la situation de Marie Dupont ?" → AI summarizes donor history, last interactions, pending tasks
  - Example: "@Libero rédige un brouillon de relance pour cette subvention" → AI drafts a grant renewal message
- **AI-generated activity summaries**: each Monday, AI posts a brief in the org feed summarizing the week's key movements
- **Proactive AI interventions**: AI posts in the feed when it detects something requiring attention ("La subvention FSE+ arrive à échéance dans 14 jours — aucun rapport en cours.")

**Impact on design**:
- The homepage dashboard evolves from a static metrics page to a **living organizational feed** (think: Linear + Notion + Slack channel, but organized around NPO data)
- Records gain a persistent "discussion" panel alongside the activity timeline
- Navigation may need a dedicated "Communication" or "Fil d'activité" section

**Decision needed**: Confirm scope for v1 vs v1.1 before implementation starts.

### 9. AI mode defaults by organization size

**Question**: Should the default AI mode (Manual / Assisted / Autopilot) differ based on organization size or type?

**Hypothesis**: A 5-person charity with no IT staff might want more automation (Autopilot default) while a 50-person NGO with dedicated data staff may prefer Manual or Assisted.

**Decision needed**: Define default mode assignment logic in onboarding wizard.

### 10. White-label and partner channel

**Question**: Is white-labeling a v1 or v2 feature? Who are the likely white-label partners?

**Context**: Nonprofit technology consultants migrating clients off Salesforce are a key distribution channel. A white-label offering (custom domain, custom logo, custom primary color) could accelerate partner adoption.

**Decision needed**: Define minimum white-label feature set and pricing tier for partners.
