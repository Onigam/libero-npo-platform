# 01 — Product Scope

> **Libero NPO Platform** — Pragmatic nonprofit operations software for European organizations.
> Last updated: 2026-02-24

## 1. Problem statement

European nonprofits running on Salesforce NPSP face a compounding set of problems:

| Problem | Impact |
|---|---|
| Salesforce licensing jumps to €75+/seat once the 10 free seats are consumed | Most operational NPOs need 15–40 users; cost becomes prohibitive |
| GDPR compliance is retrofitted, not native | Right-to-erasure, audit logs, data residency, consent management are painful to implement |
| NPSP complexity requires dedicated Salesforce admins | Small NPOs cannot afford this; they either under-use the platform or accumulate technical debt |
| US-centric data model (USD, US salutations, US tax receipts) | EU orgs spend weeks customizing for EUR, GDPR, EU charity law |
| No integrated case management or impact measurement | NPOs running programs must bolt on additional tools |
| Vendor lock-in with proprietary APIs and data formats | Exporting your own data is difficult and often incomplete |

**Libero** replaces Salesforce NPSP for small to medium European nonprofits (2–200 staff). It is purpose-built for:
- Constituent relationship management
- Fundraising (donations, pledges, campaigns)
- Grant lifecycle management
- Program delivery and beneficiary management
- Volunteer coordination
- Impact measurement and reporting
- GDPR-native compliance tooling
- Finance handoff (not a full accounting system)

## 2. Vision statement

> **"Every nonprofit should have enterprise-grade constituent and program management, without needing a Salesforce admin — and without navigating 16 modules for a simple question."**

Libero est conçu comme un **dual-mode platform** :
- **GUI IA-augmenté** : interface structurée classique (modules, formulaires, tableaux) enrichie par trois niveaux de collaboration IA (Manuel, Assisté, Autopilote — cf. [docs/13-ai-modes.md](./13-ai-modes.md)).
- **Mode conversationnel** (vision 2026-2028) : agent IA en langage naturel, capable d'orchestrer des actions multi-étapes, d'afficher des résultats inline, et de réduire 80 % des interactions quotidiennes à une conversation — cf. [docs/vision/conversational-mode.md](./vision/conversational-mode.md).

Les deux paradigmes coexistent et partagent le même back-end, les mêmes garde-fous RGPD, et le même système de permissions.

## 3. AI-native UX principle (cross-feature)

Libero should use AI agents **inside each core workflow** to reduce clicks, reduce admin burden, and improve data quality — without hiding critical decisions.

Design rules:
- AI proposes, human confirms for sensitive operations (finance, compliance, beneficiary status)
- Explainability required: each suggestion includes "why" + source fields
- Trust boundaries: no irreversible action without confirmation
- Full auditability of AI actions/prompts/outputs
- Progressive disclosure: simple UX for non-technical NGO teams

Research requirement:
For each major feature, run a lightweight UX research loop:
1) identify top friction tasks
2) map where an AI assistant can remove complexity
3) prototype AI-assisted interaction
4) measure time saved + error reduction + confidence



> **"Every nonprofit should have enterprise-grade constituent and program management, without needing a Salesforce admin."**

Libero is not trying to be Salesforce. It is trying to be the tool that 80% of nonprofits actually need: fast to set up, genuinely affordable, GDPR-compliant by default, and deployable in a week — not six months.

## 3. Target customers

### Primary: Small-to-medium European NPOs

| Characteristic | Range |
|---|---|
| Annual operating budget | €50K – €5M |
| Staff count | 3 – 150 FTE + volunteers |
| Active constituents (donors + beneficiaries) | 500 – 100,000 |

- US-based organizations (different tax receipt law, different payment rails)
- Pure advocacy / political organizations (different data model)
- Universities and hospitals (too specialized)

## 5. Explicit out-of-scope for v1

| Legacy postal mail fulfilment | Physical logistics out of scope | Export → mail house |
| Staff HR / payroll | Not nonprofit-specific | Integration with HR system |
| Board governance / meeting management | Different buyer | Integration with Boardable/BoardEffect |

| Organizations successfully migrated from Salesforce | 30+ |
| Average setup time (from signup to live operations) | < 5 days |
| NPS (Net Promoter Score) | > 45 |

## 7. Definition of MVP

MVP is achieved when a single NPO can:
1. Import their constituent list (CSV or from Salesforce)
2. Record a donation and generate a GDPR-compliant receipt
3. Run a campaign and see how much it raised
4. Enroll a beneficiary in a program and record a service delivery
5. Export gift aid / tax reclaim data
6. Run a donor retention (LYBUNT) report
7. Comply with a GDPR subject access request for a constituent

Everything else is Phase 2 or Phase 3.
